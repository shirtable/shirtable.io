    <p>Shirtable is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, choice of OS or text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form. Workshop participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the workshop without a refund at the discretion of the workshop organizers.</p>
<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.</li>
<li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
<li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund.</p>
<p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!</p>
<h3>Reporting</h3>
<p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.</p>
<p>You can make a report either personally or anonymously.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Report</h3>
<p>You can make an anonymous report <a href="https://shirtable.wufoo.com/forms/report-of-shirtable-code-of-conduct-violation/">using our anonymous reporting tool</a>.</p>
<p>We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.</p>
<h3>Personal Report</h3>
<p>You can make a personal report by contacting a staff member (Marty or Joshua).</p>
<p>When taking a personal report, we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.</p>
<h3>Attribution</h3>
<p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki</a>, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.</p>
<p>This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.</p>
