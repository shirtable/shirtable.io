    <h1>A low-stress coding workshop for non-techies</h1>
<p>You are a successful and intelligent professional working in a non-technical field (marketing, policy, education, management). You know
that software is the future and you need to learn more
about computers and coding, but online coding classes are too
impersonal, and coding bootcamps seem intimidating.</p>
<p>In our basics workshop you will learn the fundamentals of programming
in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, walking away with techniques for
structuring and manipulating data to gain insights that would be
tedious, time consuming, and often impossible from a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Leveraging a data set containing more than 200,000 baby name entries
from data.gov (yes, you read that right), you will write code that can
answer questions such as, "how many male babies were born in 2012 with
four-letter names?" and "how many babies were born in 2010?"</p>
<p>While the technical challenges you face in your career probably won't
involve baby names (but really, you never know), the techniques you
learn can be applied to any data set, allowing you to answer complex
questions about your data in just a few commands.</p>
<p>In the basics workshop you will learn more than just the basics of the
Python programming language -- you will learn how to think like a
software developer so that you can effectively tackle technical
challenges, communicate with technical teams and most importantly,
understand how solutions to complex data problems are built from
simple pieces which can be assembled with even just a basic knowledge
of Python.</p>
<h1>Why Python?</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is a powerful yet easy to learn
programming language that's used everywhere from web servers, to NASA,
to Google's Compute Engine. Python is more than just a programming
language. It's also a community that understands that code is more
than just instructions for computers - it's for people, by people. We
want to help get you plugged in to a community of folks that want you
to succeed and grow.</p>
<h1>Upcoming Workshops</h1>
<p>The Shirtable team is currently on hiatus and no workshops are being
planned for the immediate future. However, if you sign up for the
mailing list you will be the first to be notified when the team is
back from break and is preparing a new workshop.</p>
<p>Note: this list is only used for notifications about upcoming Shirtable
workshops - we will not use your email address for any other purpose.</p>

<h1>We are Shirtable</h1>
<p>Joshua R. Smith and Marty McGuire are Shirtable.</p>
<p><a href="http://jrsmith3.github.io/">Joshua Smith's</a> specialty is developing
mathematical models of physical systems and implementing them in
software using industry-standard software development practices. In
his day job, Joshua is a Senior Computational Scientist at
<a href="https://www.xometry.com/">Xometry</a> and is responsible for designing
and implementing Xometry's geometric analysis and quoting engine.
Joshua has over a decade of experience writing Python code.</p>
<p><a href="https://martymcgui.re/">Marty McGuire</a> is a web and operations
developer with 12+ years experience building and deploying websites for
clients such as MakerBot and Adafruit Industries.</p>
<p>We take an empathetic but hands-on approach to teaching coding skills
based on the most recent computing education research. The lessons are
designed to be approachable by professionals not in a technical field
without being patronizing -- you have worked hard to be successful in
your career and are trying to learn new skills. We create a welcoming
environment for you to learn, and we give you the opportunity to
leverage our experience in web technologies and scientific
computation. Participants are encouraged to help one another and apply
what they have learned to their own research problems.</p>
