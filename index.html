    <p><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is not just a programming language.
It's also a community that understands that code is more than just
instructions for computers - it's for people, by people.</p>
<p>At Shirtable, we want to introduce you to a powerful programming
language that runs on everything from the tiny Raspberry Pi all the way
up to Google's Compute Engine. More than that, we want to help get you
plugged in to a community of folks that want you to succeed and grow.</p>
<p>Shirtable hands-on workshops cover basic concepts and tools for
calculation and visualization using Python. Participants are encouraged
to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
research problems.</p>
